Instacart Market Basket Analysis

Which products will an Instacart consumer purchase again?

The Instacart Market Basket Analysis is a project that aims to predict which products a consumer is likely to purchase again during their next order. By analyzing historical purchase data from millions of orders, the goal is to uncover patterns and insights about consumer behavior. This analysis helps in understanding customer preferences, improving product recommendations, and optimizing inventory management. Key aspects include examining product reorder rates, identifying frequent product combinations, and leveraging machine learning models to make accurate predictions about future purchases.

For this analysis, I will use a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a product being reordered. Logistic regression is suitable for this task as it can handle binary outcomes (reordered or not reordered) and provides probabilities that help in making informed predictions. By predicting which products an Instacart consumer will purchase again, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth through personalized shopping experiences.

## Load the necessary Packages
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(ROCR)
library(dplyr)
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)
```

## Load the Data

For this project we will Load the customer dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand its structure and contents. This step involves reading the CSV file and inspecting the first few rows to get a sense of the data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
customer_data <- read.csv("~/Documents/Summer 2024/R_Activities_Summer 2024/Assignment/Website (Portfolio)/instacart-market-basket-analysis/order_products__prior.csv")
head(customer_data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
glimpse(customer_data)
```


## Data Preprocessing
Clean the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. In this case, we may not need extensive preprocessing since the dataset is already structured:

```{r}
# Check the structure of the data
str(customer_data)
```
Checking for missing values
```{r}
# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(customer_data))
```

## Step-by-Step Logistic Regression:
1. Understanding Logistic Regression:
Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable (or outcome) is categorical. It predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic curve.

2. Data Preparation:

Dependent Variable (Response): reordered (binary categorical: 0 or 1).
Independent Variables (Predictors): Typically numeric or categorical predictors like order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order.

3. Data Exploration:
Explore your data to understand distributions, relationships, and any initial insights.

4. Model Building:
Formulate the Model: Specify the logistic regression model equation:

logit(𝑝) =𝛽0+𝛽1𝑥1+𝛽2𝑥2+⋯+𝛽𝑛𝑥𝑛
 
where 
𝑝p is the probability of the dependent variable, and 𝛽0,𝛽1,…,𝛽𝑛β 0 are coefficients.


## Computing Probabilities
Compute the probabilities of reordered being 1 using the logistic regression model. Here’s how you can do it:

```{r}
# Fit logistic regression model (assuming df is your preprocessed dataframe)
model <- glm(reordered ~ ., data = customer_data, family = "binomial")
```

```{r}
# Predict probabilities
probabilities <- predict(model, type = "response")
```

```{r}
# Append probabilities to your dataframe for reference
customer_data$predicted_probability <- probabilities

```

```{r}
# View the probabilities
head(customer_data[, c("reordered", "predicted_probability")])
```
## Calculating Conditional Odds
Calculating the conditional odds of products being reordered based on the logistic regression model can provide valuable insights into how each product contributes to the likelihood of being reordered. 

After fitting the logistic regression model, you can use the model coefficients to calculate the conditional odds for each product. Conditional odds represent the change in odds of an event (in this case, product being reordered) associated with a one-unit change in the predictor variable (product_id).

Step-by-Step Calculation:
Extract Coefficients from the Model:
First, extract the coefficients (beta) from the logistic regression model.

```{r}
# Assuming 'model' is your fitted logistic regression model
coefficients <- coef(model)
```

Calculate Odds Ratios (Conditional Odds):
Use the coefficients to calculate the odds ratios, which represent the conditional odds for each product (product_id).

Here exp(coefficients[-1]) calculates the exponential of each coefficient (excluding the intercept) to obtain the odds ratios.
```{r}
# Calculate odds ratios (conditional odds)
odds_ratios <- exp(coefficients[-1])
```

Copy code

```{r}
# Create a dataframe to store product_id and corresponding odds ratios
product_odds <- data.frame(product_id = names(odds_ratios), odds_ratio = odds_ratios)

# View the conditional odds for each product
print(product_odds)
```

## Interpretation

Based on the above results:

order_id and product_id: These variables have odds ratios close to 1 (1.0000000 and 1.0000007 respectively). An odds ratio of 1 suggests that there is no change in the odds of reordered for a one-unit increase in these variables. This could imply that these variables may not significantly influence the odds of reordered based on the current model.

add_to_cart_order: This variable has an odds ratio of approximately 0.9625898. An odds ratio less than 1 suggests that for every one-unit increase in add_to_cart_order, the odds of reordered decrease by approximately 3.74% ((1−0.9625898)×100)

order_id and product_id do not show a significant impact on the odds of reordered based on the current model.
add_to_cart_order has a slight negative impact, implying that products added later to the cart might be slightly less likely to be reordered.

## Refining the Model

Due to the insignificant results we need to optimize its predictive power and interpretability by identifying and addressing issues such as irrelevant variables or potential interactions.

1. Variable Selection:
Identify Variables with Minimal Impact:
Coefficient Significance: Review the coefficients and their significance levels (p-values). Variables with high p-values (typically > 0.05) may indicate they are not statistically significant and can potentially be removed.
Now considering the relevance of each variable to the outcome (reordered). Variables like order_id and product_id might not directly influence reorder likelihood and could be candidates for removal.
```{r}
# Example: Checking significance of coefficients
summary(model)
```
based on these results, the significant Variables are product_id and add_to_cart_order as they appear to be statistically significant predictors of reordered.

Explore Interactions between Variables:
2. Interaction Terms: predictors (product_id and add_to_cart_order) are significant based on their coefficients and p-values.
Create interaction terms to capture potential combined effects of these predictors on reordered.
Interaction Effects: Investigate if the effect of one predictor variable on the outcome varies depending on the value of another predictor. 
```{r}
# Adding interaction term between product_id and add_to_cart_order
model_interaction <- glm(reordered ~ product_id * add_to_cart_order, data = customer_data, family = "binomial")
```

Interpretation of Interaction Terms:
Coefficient Interpretation: Examine the coefficients of the interaction terms. A significant interaction indicates that the effect of one predictor on the outcome depends on the level of the other predictor.
Significance Testing: Check the p-values associated with the interaction terms to determine if they are statistically significant.
```{r}
# Checking significance of interaction terms
summary(model_interaction)
```

3. Model Validation:
Validate Model Performance:
Cross-Validation: Split your dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new data. This helps avoid overfitting.
```{r}
# Cross-validation in R
set.seed(123)
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
cv_model <- train(reordered ~ order_id + product_id + add_to_cart_order, data = customer_data, method = "glm", trControl = train_control, family = "binomial")
summary(cv_model)
```

ROC Curve and AUC: Plotting the ROC curve and calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) helps assess the model's discriminatory ability.
```{r}
# ROC curve and AUC calculation
library(pROC)
roc_curve <- roc(customer_data$reordered, cv_model$finalModel$fitted.values)
plot(roc_curve)
auc(roc_curve)
```

Plotting Interactions:
Visualize interactions using plots to understand how the relationship between predictors and reordered changes across different levels of the interacting variables.

```{r}
#Plotting interactions (if significant)
plot(df$product_id, df$add_to_cart_order, col = df$reordered)

```

Evaluating Model Improvement
Model Comparison: Compare the model with interactions (model_interaction) to the baseline model without interactions (model) using metrics like AIC/BIC or cross-validation.
```{r}
# Compare AIC/BIC of models
AIC(model)
AIC(model_interaction)
```

Predictive Power: Assess if adding interaction terms improves the model’s predictive power and interpretability based on validation metrics such as ROC curve analysis.

```{r}
# ROC curve analysis
library(pROC)
roc_curve <- roc(customer_data$reordered, predict(model_interaction, type = "response"))
plot(roc_curve)
```


Conclusion
Exploring interactions between significant predictors (product_id and add_to_cart_order) allows you to capture nuanced relationships that may improve your logistic regression model's ability to predict reordered. It’s essential to interpret the results carefully and validate the model enhancements to ensure robustness and generalizability.
